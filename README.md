# Food-Ordering-System

A Real-time online food ordering system for the customer is our proposed system.
Food can be ordered online in a hassle-free manner through our proposed system from
restaurants. The food order-taking methods from customers are improved by our system
application. Separate accounts are maintained for each user for more secured ordering by
providing an ID and a password. Also, customers can easily track the orders with the food
menu. The management improves food delivery service and preserves customersâ€™
database.
